The project's main goal is to develop an online book store where users can search for and make purchases of books based on Book name, author name, and category(old/new). The user's chosen books are displayed in a 
tabular format, and they can order them online using a COD. Instead of going to a bookstore and wasting time, the user can purchase a book on this website. 
A customer can also sell his/her old book to another customer by adding book and contact details. To buy the old book, the user will have to take the contact details of the customer by clicking on “View Details” 
buttons.
